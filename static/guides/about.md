## About Sightreading.training

This site is a way for you to practice [sight reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight-reading) by playing randomly generated sheet music or by playing along with pre-programmed songs.

### How this site works


There are many different tools included to practice your music and sight reading skills:

* **Staff** -- Notes are randomly generated for you to sight read and play. This will ensure that you're always reading and never playing from memory. In the simplest mode you'll play one note at a time, but you can increase complexity by clicking **configure**, and changing how notes are generated. In order to play more than 1 note at a time you need a MIDI controller connected!
* **Play Along** -- Pre-programmed songs are available for you to play. You can control the playback speed, and configure a metronome by using the MIDI output option.
* **Ear Training** -- Various tools to practice your ear, including interval recognition and playing back a melody.

### Using a MIDI keyboard

Although it's possible to play using your mouse or computer keyboard, we recommend connecting your digital piano or MIDI keyboard to your computer so you can play directly into the software. A MIDI keyboard is required to enter multiple notes at the same time.

MIDI support is only available in Chrome at this time. If you have a USB OTG
cable you can even connect your keyboard to your Android phone or tablet.
